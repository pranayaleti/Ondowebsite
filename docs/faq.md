## General Questions

### What is a full stack developer and what do they do?

A full stack developer is a software engineer who works on both the frontend (user interface) and backend (server, database) of web applications. They handle everything from designing user interfaces to building APIs, managing databases, and deploying applications. OndoSoft's full stack developers use modern technologies like React, Node.js, Python, PostgreSQL, and cloud platforms to build complete web applications, SaaS platforms, and custom software solutions for businesses across the United States.

### What is SaaS and how does it work?

SaaS (Software as a Service) is a cloud-based software delivery model where applications are hosted online and accessed through web browsers. Instead of installing software, users subscribe to access the application. Popular examples include Salesforce, Slack, and Zoom. OndoSoft specializes in building SaaS applications with features like multi-tenant architecture, subscription management, payment processing, user authentication, and scalable cloud infrastructure. We help businesses build, launch, and scale SaaS products from concept to enterprise level.

### What programming languages are best for web development in 2024?

The best programming languages for web development in 2024 include JavaScript (React, Node.js, TypeScript) for full stack development, Python for backend services and data processing, Java for enterprise applications, and modern frameworks like Next.js and Vue.js. OndoSoft uses these technologies along with PostgreSQL, MongoDB, AWS, and Docker to build modern web applications. The choice depends on project requirements, scalability needs, and team expertise. We help businesses choose the right technology stack for their specific needs.

### How much does it cost to build a custom website?

The cost to build a custom website varies based on complexity, features, and requirements. Simple business websites start around $1,200-$5,000, while complex web applications can cost $10,000-$50,000+. SaaS platforms typically range from $25,000-$100,000+ depending on features. OndoSoft offers transparent pricing for custom websites, web applications, and SaaS platforms. We provide detailed quotes after understanding your specific requirements, ensuring you get the best value for your investment.

### What is the difference between a website and a web application?

A website is typically informational with static or semi-static content, while a web application is interactive software that runs in a browser with dynamic functionality, user accounts, data processing, and complex features. Websites are great for marketing and information, while web applications enable users to perform tasks, manage data, and interact with systems. OndoSoft builds both websites and web applications, using modern technologies like React, Node.js, and cloud platforms to create solutions that meet your specific business needs.

### Why choose OndoSoft over individual contractors or other agencies?

We provide transparent communication, fixed timelines, and reliable delivery—so you get your project done on schedule without surprises.

### What is React and why is it popular for web development?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed by Facebook. It's popular because it enables component-based development, improves code reusability, offers excellent performance with virtual DOM, has a large ecosystem, and is widely used by companies like Facebook, Netflix, and Airbnb. OndoSoft specializes in React development, using it along with Next.js, Node.js, and modern tools to build fast, scalable web applications and SaaS platforms for businesses across the United States.

### What is cloud computing and why should I use it?

Cloud computing delivers computing services (servers, storage, databases, networking) over the internet instead of on-premises hardware. Benefits include scalability, cost savings, automatic updates, remote access, and reliability. Popular cloud providers include AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. OndoSoft helps businesses migrate to the cloud and build cloud-native applications, providing expertise in AWS, Google Cloud, Docker, Kubernetes, and DevOps practices to ensure scalable, secure, and cost-effective cloud solutions.

### How do I know if my business needs custom software development?

Your business needs custom software development if off-the-shelf solutions don't meet your specific requirements, you need to automate unique business processes, you want to integrate multiple systems, you need a competitive advantage through technology, or you're building a SaaS product. OndoSoft helps businesses determine if custom development is right for them, offering consultations to assess needs, recommend solutions, and provide cost-effective development services for custom web applications, SaaS platforms, and business automation tools.

### What is agile development methodology?

Agile development is an iterative approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and continuous improvement. Instead of long planning phases, agile uses short sprints (1-4 weeks) to deliver working software incrementally. Benefits include faster delivery, adaptability to changes, better collaboration, and continuous feedback. OndoSoft uses agile methodologies including Scrum and Kanban, ensuring transparent communication, regular updates, and the ability to adapt to changing requirements throughout the development process.

### How do I ensure my website is secure?

Website security involves HTTPS encryption, regular security updates, secure authentication, input validation, protection against SQL injection and XSS attacks, regular backups, and security monitoring.

We help businesses build secure web applications and SaaS platforms that protect user data and maintain trust.

### What is responsive web design and why is it important?

Responsive web design ensures websites work well on all devices (desktops, tablets, smartphones) by adapting layout and content to different screen sizes. It's important because mobile traffic accounts for over 50% of web traffic, Google prioritizes mobile-friendly sites in search rankings, and users expect seamless experiences across devices. OndoSoft builds fully responsive websites and web applications using modern CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS, ensuring optimal user experience and better SEO performance on all devices.

### How long does it take to develop a web application?

Web application development timelines vary based on complexity: simple websites take 2-4 weeks, standard web applications take 6-12 weeks, complex SaaS platforms take 3-6 months, and enterprise applications can take 6-12 months. Factors include features, integrations, design complexity, and team size. OndoSoft provides realistic timelines during initial consultation, using agile methodologies to deliver working software incrementally and ensure projects stay on schedule.

### What is API development and why do I need it?

API (Application Programming Interface) development creates interfaces that allow different software systems to communicate and share data. APIs enable mobile apps to connect to servers, third-party integrations, microservices architecture, and data sharing between systems. OndoSoft develops RESTful APIs and GraphQL APIs using Node.js, Python, and modern frameworks, enabling seamless integration between web applications, mobile apps, third-party services, and internal systems for businesses across the United States.

### How do I maintain and update my website after launch?

Website maintenance includes regular updates, security patches, content updates, performance monitoring, backup management, and bug fixes. OndoSoft provides comprehensive maintenance services including regular updates, security monitoring, performance optimization, content management, technical support, and feature additions.
